#  Deque Implementation Using Linked List

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)** using a **doubly linked list** in C++. A deque allows insertion and deletion from both front and rear ends efficiently. The code is self-contained in a single file.

##  File Structure

```

DequeImplementation/
└── dequeimplementationUsingLinkedlist.cpp

````

##  Features

- Insert element at the front
- Insert element at the rear
- Delete element from the front
- Delete element from the rear
- Display all elements in the deque
- Check if deque is empty

##  Technologies Used

- C++  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Doubly Linked List  

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vishnu-8349/DequeImplementation.git
   cd DequeImplementation
````

2. Compile and run:

   ```bash
   g++ dequeimplementationUsingLinkedlist.cpp -o deque
   ./deque
   ```

##  Learning Outcomes

* Understand the concept and operations of a Deque
* Apply linked list techniques for dynamic memory handling
* Strengthen command-line C++ programming skills
